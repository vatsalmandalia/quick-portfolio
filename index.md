### 2. Categorise countries using socio-economic factors for deciding recipients of USD10 million financial aid from HELP organization
[View on Github](https://github.com/vatsalmandalia/Country-Data-Kmeans-Clustering.git)

Classified 167 countries using 10 socio-economic factors into three groups by applying K-Means Clustering. Optimal number of clusters/groups is determined using elbow-curve method. Scaled down the data using StandardScaler and managed outliers by capping them to avoid their effect on algorithm performance. For my analysis, I defined the groups as 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low' for each feature like life expectancy, health expenditure etc.

After classifying, Plotly library in Python is used to visualize the countries in three colours on a world map.
